# ItemStacks
Reduce Client and Server lags by letting items stack

## What does this do?
It simply stacks the items like MC PC (Java) Edition does, so reducing the amount of total items in the world, which then also reduces server and client lag.

## How does it work?
It simply executes a task every 15 ticks (changeable in config), which then checks for each item if they are equal and stackable

## Does this lag?
Well, it could lag a bit when there are too many dropped items in the world, but after they stack together the lag will be less then before the mass of items

## How can we thank you for the plugin?
Use it ;)
Thats quite all. Just use it, share it with your friends.
If you want, you can even donate me some coins and bucks: https://www.paypal.me/XenialDan

## Can we modify the plugin?
No, please read the license. (Why in the world would you need to modify the plugin anyways?)
